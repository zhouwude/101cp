1. update the burst capacity of the kpa
```
kubectl annotate kpa fn-00001 autoscaling.knative.dev/targetBurstCapacity=1
```
2. give load to the pod
```
curl http://fn.default.svc.cluster.local -I
```
3. check ep changes, and we can see public service ep is updated to the same with private service ep
```
kubectl get ep -w
```
4. difference between public and private
- private ep is only used for getting the ready pod address
- public ep is used in data path, when servicelesservice is in Proxy mode, public ep points to activator, when sks is in Serve mode, public ep points to function pods.
